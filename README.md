# boot-strap-clj

For educational purposes, I am building a clojure project from scratch starting with boot-clj.  I will avoid using lein until it is needed to see if it is possible and to find any pain points with this new tool.

Gradually, I want to develop this into a skeleton for a clojure web application

- [x] Install boot
- [x] Build
- [x] Basic boot task
- [x] Compilation and REPL access
- [ ] Web server
- [ ] Ring handler/middleware
- [ ] Deployable Jar/Heroku

..and more to be determined.
